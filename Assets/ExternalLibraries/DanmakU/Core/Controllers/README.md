#Controllers

This folder contains a number of classes that derive from `IDanmakuControllers`.

Danmaku Controllers are a high performance, parametric way of defining bullet behaviour, and custom controllers can be created by implementing `IDanmakuController` on any concrete class.

See the [wiki page](https://github.com/Rhythmia/DanmakU/wiki/Danmaku-Controllers) on Danmaku Controllers for more information.
