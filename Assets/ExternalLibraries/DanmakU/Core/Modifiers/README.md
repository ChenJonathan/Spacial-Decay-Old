#Modifiers
This folder contains implementations of `FireModifier`.

As the name suggests, `FireModifiers` change the way a single fire appears. It can change the starting position, rotation, velocity, or even the number of bullets fired in a single fire. Fire Modifiers are an effective and modular way of expanding the way bullets are fired.
